=head1 NAME

libnbd-ocaml - how to use libnbd from OCaml

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 let nbd = NBD.create () in
 NBD.connect_uri nbd "nbd://localhost";
 let size = NBD.get_size nbd in
 printf "%Ld\n" size;
 NBD.close ()

Alternate syntax which ensures that close is called even if an
exception is thrown:

 let size =
   NBD.with_handle (
     fun nbd ->
       NBD.connect_uri nbd "nbd://localhost";
       NBD.get_size nbd
   ) in
 printf "%Ld\n" size

To compile:

 ocamlopt -I +nbd mlnbd.cmxa prog.ml -o prog

or using findlib:

 ocamlfind opt -package nbd -linkpkg prog.ml -o prog

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents how to use libnbd to access Network Block
Device (NBD) servers from the OCaml programming language.

The OCaml bindings work very similarly to the C bindings so you should
start by reading L<libnbd(3)>.

For OCaml API documentation see L<NBD(3)>.

=head1 HANDLES

Create a libnbd handle of type C<NBD.t> by calling S<C<NBD.create ()>>.

You can either close the handle explicitly by calling C<NBD.close> or
it will be closed automatically when it is garbage collected.  If you
call any other method on a handle which you have explicitly closed
then the API will throw an C<NBD.Closed> exception.

C<NBD.with_handle> can be used to make sure the handle is closed in a
timely manner.  See the example in the L</SYNOPSIS> above.

=head1 ERRORS

Libnbd errors are turned automatically into exceptions of type:

 NBD.Error (str, Unix.error option)

The first exception parameter is a string which is the printable error
message.  The second is the OCaml C<Unix.error> code, if available
(see L<nbd_get_errno(3)>).

=head2 Callbacks with "int ref" error parameter

Some callbacks take an error parameter of type C<int ref>,
corresponding to the C<int *error> passed to those callbacks in C.
See also: L<libnbd(3)/Callbacks with "int *error" parameter>

If an error occurs during the callback you can update the C<int> in
the reference, setting it to a I<C-compatible errno>.  To convert an
OCaml C<Unix.error> into a C-compatible errno call
C<NBD.errno_of_unix_error>.
