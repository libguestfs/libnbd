NBD client library in userspace

NBD — Network Block Device — is a protocol for accessing Block Devices
(hard disks and disk-like things) over a Network.  This is the NBD
client library in userspace, a simple library for writing NBD clients.

The key features are:

 * Synchronous API for ease of use.

 * Asynchronous API for writing non-blocking, multithreaded clients.
   You can mix both APIs freely.

 * High performance.

 * Minimal dependencies for the basic library.

 * Well-documented, stable API.

 * Bindings in several programming languages.

 * Shell (nbdsh) for command line and scripting.

 * Copying tool (nbdcopy) for high performance copying and streaming.

 * Query tool (nbdinfo) to query NBD servers.

 * FUSE support (nbdfuse) to mount NBD in the local filesystem.

BUILDING FROM SOURCE
====================

To build from git:

  autoreconf -i
  ./configure
  make
  make check

To build from tarball:

  ./configure
  make
  make check

To run the tests under valgrind:

  make check-valgrind

To run benchmarks:

  make bench

Some tests require root permissions (and are therefore risky).  If you
want to run these tests, do:

  sudo make check-root

On FreeBSD, OpenBSD and macOS which do not have GNU make by default
you must use 'gmake' instead of 'make'.

Requirements:

 * Linux, FreeBSD or OpenBSD.
   Other OSes may also work but we have only tested these three.

 * GCC or Clang

 * GNU make

 * bash

Required for building from git, optional for building from tarballs:

 * OCaml (ocamlc, the bytecode compiler) is required to generate some
   source files, which is needed to build from git.  However ocamlc is
   _not_ needed if building from the official tarballs from
   http://download.libguestfs.org/libnbd/ because those contain the
   generated files.

Recommended - if not present, some features will be disabled:

 * GnuTLS is recommended for TLS support.

   If not available then you will not be able to access encrypted
   servers and some APIs related to TLS will always return an error.

 * libxml2 is recommended for NBD URI support.

   If not available then a few APIs related to URIs will always return
   an error, and the nbdinfo tool is not built.

Optional:

 * Perl Pod::Man and Pod::Simple to generate the documentation.

 * OCaml and ocamlfind are both needed to generate the OCaml bindings.

 * Python >= 3.3 to build the Python 3 bindings and NBD shell (nbdsh).

 * FUSE 3 to build the nbdfuse program.

 * go and cgo, for compiling the golang bindings and tests.

 * bash-completion >= 1.99 for tab completion.

Optional, only needed to run the test suite:

 * nbdkit >= 1.12, the nbdkit basic plugins and the nbdkit basic
   filters are recommended as they are needed to run the test suite.

 * nbdkit, nbd-server, qemu-nbd and qemu-storage-daemon if you want to
   do interoperability testing against these servers.

 * A C++ compiler is needed if you want to test that the library works
   from C++.

 * coreutils or standard Unix tools such as cmp, dd, stat, truncate.

 * libdl (dlopen, dlclose etc) to test this functionality.

 * qemu, qemu-io, qemu-img for interoperability testing.

 * certtool and psktool (part of GnuTLS) for testing TLS support.

 * valgrind if you want to run the tests under valgrind.

 * nbd-client and Linux nbd.ko for testing nbdcopy to/from devices.

 * flake8 to keep Python code formatted uniformly.

 * ss (from iproute) for TCP-based tests.

Optional, only needed to run some examples:

 * glib2 for examples that interoperate with the glib main loop.

 * libev for examples that interoperate with the libev library.


DOWNLOAD TARBALLS
=================

DEVELOPERS
==========

Install the valgrind program and development headers.

Use:

    ./configure --enable-gcc-warnings --enable-python-code-style

When testing use:

    make check
    make check-valgrind

Use the following one-time setup for nicer diffs of OCaml files:

    git config diff.ml.xfuncname '^(type|and|val|let) .*='
    git config diff.ml-api.xfuncname '^(let .*=|  "[^"]*", \{$)'
    git config diff.mli.xfuncname '^(type|and|val|module) '

For development ideas, see the TODO file.

Patches are accepted either by email to the upstream mailing list:
https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libguestfs
or by Merge Request on gitlab.com

If you want to fuzz the library see fuzzing/README.
