(* The state machine.
 *
 * Each state has some associated C code which is called when
 * the state is entered, or when the state is re-entered because
 * of an external event.  That code is not in this file, it's
 * in [generator/states*.c].
 *
 * Each handle starts in the top level START state.
 *
 * When you enter a state, the associated C code for that state
 * runs.  If the C code calls SET_NEXT_STATE and returns 0 then
 * the connection enters the next state without blocking.  If the
 * C code calls SET_NEXT_STATE_AND_BLOCK and returns 0 then the
 * connection blocks, but will resume with the code for the next
 * state on the next external event.  If the C code does _not_
 * call either macro but returns 0, the state machine is blocked
 * and will not be re-entered until an external event happens
 * (see below), where the same C code will be executed again on
 * re-entry.  If the C code calls returns -1 after using
 * set_error(), then the state machine blocks and the caller
 * should report failure; the next external event will resume the
 * state machine according to whether SET_NEXT_STATE was used.
 *
 * There are various end states such as CLOSED and DEAD.  These
 * are not special in relation to the above state transition rules,
 * it's just that they have no way to move to another state.  However,
 * the DEAD state expects that set_error() was used in the previous
 * state, and will return -1 itself after performing cleanup actions;
 * the earlier state that wants to transition to DEAD should return 0
 * rather than -1, so as not to bypass this cleanup.
 *
 * An external event is something like the file descriptor being
 * ready to read or write, or the main program calling a function
 * such as [nbd_aio_connect].  Possible external events, and the
 * next state resulting, are listed in the states table below.
 *
 * An empty string [""] for an external event’s next state means
 * the same state is re-entered.  The same C code for the state
 * will be run again.
 *
 * States can be grouped hierarchically.  States can be referred
 * to by an absolute path from the top level, such as ".DEAD",
 * or by a relative path from the current level, such as "CONNECT"
 * (another state at the same level), "REPLY.START" (a state in
 * a sub-group), or "^FINISH_COMMAND" (a state in the level above
 * the current one).  When entering a group you must enter at the
 * START state.  When leaving a group and going to a higher level
 * in the state tree there is no restriction on the next state.

additional sanity checking on the server's reply. The callback cannot
call C<nbd_*> APIs on the same handle since it holds the handle lock

earlier error has been detected, then the overall read command will
fail with any non-zero value stored into the callback's C<error>
parameter (with a default of C<EPROTO>); but any further chunks will
still invoke the callback.

The C<chunk> function is called once per chunk of data received, with
the C<user_data> passed to this function.  The
C<subbuf> and C<count> parameters represent the subset of the original
buffer which has just been populated by results from the server (in C,
C<subbuf> always points within the original C<buf>; but this guarantee
may not extend to other language bindings). The C<offset> parameter
represents the absolute offset at which C<subbuf> begins within the
image (note that this is not the relative offset of C<subbuf> within
the original buffer C<buf>). Changes to C<error> on output are ignored
unless the callback fails. The input meaning of the C<error> parameter
is controlled by the C<status> parameter, which is one of

C<subbuf> was populated with C<count> bytes of data. On input, C<error>
contains the errno value of any earlier detected error, or zero.

C<subbuf> represents a hole, and contains C<count> NUL bytes. On input,
C<error> contains the errno value of any earlier detected error, or zero.

=item C<LIBNBD_READ_ERROR> = 3

C<count> is 0, so C<subbuf> is unusable. On input, C<error> contains the
errno value reported by the server as occurring while reading that
C<offset>, regardless if any earlier error has been detected.

=back

Future NBD extensions may permit other values for C<status>, but those
will not be returned to a client that has not opted in to requesting
such extensions. If the server is non-compliant, it is possible for
the C<chunk> function to be called more times than you expect or with
C<count> 0 for C<LIBNBD_READ_DATA> or C<LIBNBD_READ_HOLE>. It is also
possible that the C<chunk> function is not called at all (in
particular, C<LIBNBD_READ_ERROR> is used only when an error is
associated with a particular offset, and not when the server reports a
generic error), but you are guaranteed that the callback was called at
least once if the overall read succeeds. Libnbd does not validate that
the server obeyed the requirement that a read call must not have
overlapping chunks and must not succeed without enough chunks to cover
the entire request.

The C<flags> parameter may be C<0> for no flags, or may contain
C<LIBNBD_CMD_FLAG_DF> meaning that the server should not reply with
more than one fragment (if that is supported - some servers cannot do
this, see C<nbd_can_df>). Libnbd does not validate that the server

Issue the block status command to the NBD server.  If
supported by the server, this causes metadata context
information about blocks beginning from the specified
offset to be returned. The C<count> parameter is a hint: the
server may choose to return less status, or the final block
may extend beyond the requested range. If multiple contexts
are supported, the number of blocks and cumulative length
of those blocks need not be identical between contexts.

Depending on which metadata contexts were enabled before
connecting (see C<nbd_add_meta_context>) and which are
supported by the server (see C<nbd_can_meta_context>) this call
returns information about extents by calling back to the
C<extent> function.  The callback cannot call C<nbd_*> APIs on the
same handle since it holds the handle lock and will
cause a deadlock.  If the callback returns C<-1>, and no earlier
error has been detected, then the overall block status command
will fail with any non-zero value stored into the callback's
C<error> parameter (with a default of C<EPROTO>); but any further
contexts will still invoke the callback.

The C<extent> function is called once per type of metadata available,
with the C<user_data> passed to this function.  The C<metacontext>
parameter is a string such as C<\"base:allocation\">.  The C<entries>
array is an array of pairs of integers with the first entry in each
pair being the length (in bytes) of the block and the second entry
being a status/flags field which is specific to the metadata context.
(The number of pairs passed to the function is C<nr_entries/2>.)  The
NBD protocol document in the section about
C<NBD_REPLY_TYPE_BLOCK_STATUS> describes the meaning of this array;
for contexts known to libnbd, B<E<lt>libnbd.hE<gt>> contains constants
beginning with C<LIBNBD_STATE_> that may help decipher the values.
On entry to the callback, the C<error> parameter contains the errno
value of any previously detected error.

It is possible for the extent function to be called
more times than you expect (if the server is buggy),
so always check the C<metacontext> field to ensure you
are receiving the data you expect.  It is also possible
that the extent function is not called at all, even for
metadata contexts that you requested.  This indicates
either that the server doesn't support the context
or for some other reason cannot return the data.

The C<flags> parameter may be C<0> for no flags, or may contain
C<LIBNBD_CMD_FLAG_REQ_ONE> meaning that the server should
return only one extent per metadata context where that extent
does not exceed C<count> bytes; however, libnbd does not
validate that the server obeyed the flag.";

=item 0

We are not expected to interact with the server file descriptor from
the current state. It is not worth attempting to use L<poll(2)>; if
the connection is not dead, then state machine progress must instead
come from some other means such as C<nbd_aio_connect>.

=item C<LIBNBD_AIO_DIRECTION_READ> = 1

We are expected next to read from the server.  If using L<poll(2)>
you would set C<events = POLLIN>.  If C<revents> returns C<POLLIN>
or C<POLLHUP> you would then call C<nbd_aio_notify_read>.

Note that once libnbd reaches C<nbd_aio_is_ready>, this direction is
returned even when there are no commands in flight (see
C<nbd_aio_in_flight>). In a single-threaded use of libnbd, it is not
worth polling until after issuing a command, as otherwise the server
will never wake up the poll. In a multi-threaded scenario, you can
have one thread begin a polling loop prior to any commands, but any
other thread that issues a command will need a way to kick the
polling thread out of poll in case issuing the command changes the
needed polling direction. Possible ways to do this include polling
for activity on a pipe-to-self, or using L<pthread_kill(3)> to send
a signal that is masked except during L<ppoll(2)>.

=item C<LIBNBD_AIO_DIRECTION_WRITE> = 2

We are expected next to write to the server.  If using L<poll(2)>
you would set C<events = POLLOUT>.  If C<revents> returns C<POLLOUT>
you would then call C<nbd_aio_notify_write>.

=item C<LIBNBD_AIO_DIRECTION_BOTH> = 3

We are expected next to either read or write to the server.  If using
L<poll(2)> you would set C<events = POLLIN|POLLOUT>.  If only one of
C<POLLIN> or C<POLLOUT> is returned, then see above.  However, if both
are returned, it is better to call only C<nbd_aio_notify_read>, as
processing the server's reply may change the state of the connection
and invalidate the need to write more commands.

=head1 NAME

libnbd-api - libnbd C API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <libnbd.h>
 
 struct nbd_handle *nbd;
 char buf[512];
 
 if ((nbd = nbd_create ()) == NULL ||
     nbd_connect_tcp (nbd, \"server.example.com\", \"nbd\") == -1 ||
     nbd_pread (nbd, buf, sizeof buf, 0, 0) == -1)
   fprintf (stderr, \"%%s\\n\", nbd_get_error ());
   exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
 }
 nbd_close (nbd);

 cc prog.c -o prog -lnbd
or:
 cc prog.c -o prog `pkg-config libnbd --cflags --libs`

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page describes all of the libnbd API calls from C
in detail.  If you want an overview of using the API, or to see
how to call the API from other programming languages, start
with libnbd(3).

For the sake of conditional compilation across a range of libnbd
versions, where a client may take advantage of newer API when present
but gracefully continue to compile even when it is not, all functions
declared in B<E<lt>libnbd.hE<gt>> have a corresponding witness macro
with prefix C<LIBNBD_HAVE_>. For example, C<nbd_create> has a
counterpart macro C<LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_CREATE> defined to C<1>.

=head1 CREATE, GET AND CLOSE HANDLES

 struct nbd_handle *nbd;

This opaque structure describes an NBD client handle and
connection to an NBD server.

 struct nbd_handle *nbd_create (void);

Create a new handle.  Returns a pointer to the opaque handle
structure.

On error this returns C<NULL>.  See L<libnbd(3)/ERROR HANDLING>
for how to get further details of the error.

 void nbd_close (struct nbd_handle *nbd);

Closes the handle and frees any associated resources.  The final
status of any command that has not been retired (whether by
C<nbd_aio_command_completed> or by a low-level completion callback
returning C<1>) is lost.  This function is not safe to call while
any other thread is still using any C<nbd_*> API on the same handle.

=head1 GETTING THE LATEST ERROR MESSAGE IN THE THREAD

See L<libnbd(3)/ERROR HANDLING> for more discussion of how
error handling works in libnbd.

 const char *nbd_get_error (void);

Return the most recent error message in the current thread.
The error message is only valid if called immediately after
the failing call, from the same thread.  The error string
returned will be freed up next time any libnbd API is called
from the same thread, so if you need to keep it you must make
a copy.

This should never return C<NULL> provided there was an error
returned from the immediately preceding libnbd call in the
current thread.

 int nbd_get_errno (void);

Return the most recent C<errno> in the current thread.  Not all
errors have corresponding errnos, so even if there has been an error
this may return C<0>.  Error codes are the standard ones from
C<E<lt>errno.hE<gt>>.

Exception thrown when the underlying libnbd call fails.

This exception has three properties to query the error.  Use
the .string property to return a printable string containing
the error message.  Use the .errnum property for the associated
numeric error value (which may be 0 if the error did not
correspond to a system call failure), or the .errno property to
return a string containing the Python errno name if one is known
(which may be None if the numeric value does not correspond to
a known errno name).
