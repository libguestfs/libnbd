By default, libnbd tries to negotiate all possible handshake flags
that are also supported by the server, since omitting a handshake
flag can prevent the use of other functionality such as TLS encryption
or structured replies.  However, for integration testing, it can be
useful to reduce the set of flags supported by the client to test that
a particular server can handle various clients that were compliant to
older versions of the NBD specification.

The C<flags> argument is a bitmask, including zero or more of the
following handshake flags:

=over 4

=item C<LIBNBD_HANDSHAKE_FLAG_FIXED_NEWSTYLE> = 1

The server gracefully handles unknown option requests from the
client, rather than disconnecting.  Without this flag, a client
cannot safely request to use extensions such as TLS encryption or
structured replies, as the request may cause an older server to
drop the connection.

=item C<LIBNBD_HANDSHAKE_FLAG_NO_ZEROES> = 2

If the client is forced to use C<NBD_OPT_EXPORT_NAME> instead of
the preferred C<NBD_OPT_GO>, this flag allows the server to send
fewer all-zero padding bytes over the connection.

By default, libnbd tries to detect requests that would trigger

side without causing any network traffic, rather than risking
undefined server behavior.  However, for integration testing, it
can be handy to relax the strictness of libnbd, to coerce it into
sending such requests over the network for testing the robustness
of the server in dealing with such traffic.

The C<flags> argument is a bitmask, including zero or more of the
following strictness flags:

=over 4

=item C<LIBNBD_STRICT_COMMANDS> = 1

If set, this flag rejects client requests that do not comply with the
set of advertised server flags (for example, attempting a write on
a read-only server, or attempting to use C<LIBNBD_CMD_FLAG_FUA> when
L<nbd_can_fua(3)> returned false).  If clear, this flag relies on the
server to reject unexpected commands.

=item C<LIBNBD_STRICT_FLAGS> = 2

If set, this flag rejects client requests that attempt to set a
command flag not recognized by libnbd (those outside of
C<LIBNBD_CMD_FLAG_MASK>), or a flag not normally associated with
a command (such as using C<LIBNBD_CMD_FLAG_FUA> on a read command).
If clear, all flags are sent on to the server, even if sending such
a flag may cause the server to change its reply in a manner that
confuses libnbd, perhaps causing deadlock or ending the connection.

Flags that are known by libnbd as associated with a given command
(such as C<LIBNBD_CMD_FLAG_DF> for L<nbd_pread_structured(3)> gated
by L<nbd_can_df(3)>) are controlled by C<LIBNBD_STRICT_COMMANDS>
instead.

Note that the NBD protocol only supports 16 bits of command flags,
even though the libnbd API uses C<uint32_t>; bits outside of the
range permitted by the protocol are always a client-side error.

=item C<LIBNBD_STRICT_BOUNDS> = 3

If set, this flag rejects client requests that would exceed the export
bounds without sending any traffic to the server.  If clear, this flag
relies on the server to detect out-of-bounds requests.

=item C<LIBNBD_STRICT_ZERO_SIZE> = 4

If set, this flag rejects client requests with length 0.  If clear,
this permits zero-length requests to the server, which may produce
undefined results.

=item C<LIBNBD_STRICT_ALIGN> = 5

If set, and the server provided minimum block sizes (see
L<nbd_get_block_size(3)>, this flag rejects client requests that
do not have length and offset aligned to the server's minimum
requirements.  If clear, unaligned requests are sent to the server,

The NBD protocol allows a client to decide how many queries to ask

to this function, libnbd reuses the current list of requested meta
contexts as set by L<nbd_add_meta_context(3)>; you can use
L<nbd_clear_meta_contexts(3)> to set up a different list of queries.
When the list is empty, a server will typically reply with all
contexts that it supports; when the list is non-empty, the server
will reply only with supported contexts that match the client's
request.  Note that a reply by the server might be encoded to
represent several feasible contexts within one string, rather than

=item C<nbds+unix:>

Connect over a Unix domain socket, without or with TLS
respectively.  The C<socket> parameter is required.

=item C<nbd+vsock:>

=item C<nbds+vsock:>

Connect over the C<AF_VSOCK> transport, without or with
TLS respectively.

=back

The authority part of the URI (C<[username@][servername][:port]>)
is parsed depending on the transport.  For TCP it specifies the
server to connect to and optional port number.  For C<+unix>
it should not be present.  For C<+vsock> the server name is the
numeric CID (eg. C<2> to connect to the host), and the optional
port number may be present.  If the C<username> is present it
is used for TLS authentication.

For all transports, an export name may be present, parsed in
accordance with the NBD URI specification.

Finally the query part of the URI can contain:

=over 4

=item B<socket=>F<SOCKET>

Specifies the Unix domain socket to connect on.
Must be present for the C<+unix> transport and must not
be present for the other transports.

=item B<tls-certificates=>F<DIR>

Set the certificates directory.  See L<nbd_set_tls_certificates(3)>.
Note this is not allowed by default - see next section.

=item B<tls-psk-file=>F<PSKFILE>

Set the PSK file.  See L<nbd_set_tls_psk_file(3)>.  Note
this is not allowed by default - see next section.

=head2 Disable URI features

For security reasons you might want to disable certain URI
features.  Pre-filtering URIs is error-prone and should not
be attempted.  Instead use the libnbd APIs below to control
what can appear in URIs.  Note you must call these functions
on the same handle before calling L<nbd_connect_uri(3)> or
L<nbd_aio_connect_uri(3)>.

=over 4

=item TCP, Unix domain socket or C<AF_VSOCK> transports

Default: all allowed

To select which transports are allowed call
L<nbd_set_uri_allow_transports(3)>.

=item TLS

Default: both non-TLS and TLS connections allowed

To force TLS off or on in URIs call
L<nbd_set_uri_allow_tls(3)>.

=item Connect to Unix domain socket in the local filesystem

Default: allowed

To prevent this you must disable the C<+unix> transport
using L<nbd_set_uri_allow_transports(3)>.

=item Read from local files

Default: denied

To allow URIs to contain references to local files
(eg. for parameters like C<tls-psk-file>) call
L<nbd_set_uri_allow_local_file(3)>.

=back

=head2 Overriding the export name

It is possible to override the export name portion of a URI
by using L<nbd_set_opt_mode(3)> to enable option mode,
then using L<nbd_set_export_name(3)> and L<nbd_opt_go(3)>
as part of subsequent negotiation.

=head2 Optional features

This call will fail if libnbd was not compiled with libxml2; you can
test whether this is the case with L<nbd_supports_uri(3)>.

Support for URIs that require TLS will fail if libnbd was not
compiled with gnutls; you can test whether this is the case
with L<nbd_supports_tls(3)>.

request that is not aligned in length or offset to this size is likely
to fail with C<EINVAL>.  The image size will generally also be a
multiple of this value (if not, the final few bytes are inaccessible
while obeying alignment constraints).  If zero, it is safest to
assume a minimum block size of 512, although many servers support
a minimum block size of 1.  If the server provides a constraint,
then libnbd defaults to honoring that constraint client-side unless

If non-zero, this is a power of 2 representing the preferred size for
efficient I/O.  Smaller requests may incur overhead such as
read-modify-write cycles that will not be present when using I/O that
is a multiple of this value.  This value may be larger than the size
of the export.  If zero, using 4k as a preferred block size tends to

earlier error has been detected, then the overall read command will
fail with any non-zero value stored into the callback's C<error>

buffer which has just been populated by results from the server (in C,
C<subbuf> always points within the original C<buf>; but this guarantee

represents the absolute offset at which C<subbuf> begins within the

the original buffer C<buf>). Changes to C<error> on output are ignored
unless the callback fails. The input meaning of the C<error> parameter

C<count> is 0, so C<subbuf> is unusable. On input, C<error> contains the
errno value reported by the server as occurring while reading that
C<offset>, regardless if any earlier error has been detected.

Future NBD extensions may permit other values for C<status>, but those
will not be returned to a client that has not opted in to requesting
such extensions. If the server is non-compliant, it is possible for
the C<chunk> function to be called more times than you expect or with
C<count> 0 for C<LIBNBD_READ_DATA> or C<LIBNBD_READ_HOLE>. It is also
possible that the C<chunk> function is not called at all (in
particular, C<LIBNBD_READ_ERROR> is used only when an error is
associated with a particular offset, and not when the server reports a
generic error), but you are guaranteed that the callback was called at
least once if the overall read succeeds. Libnbd does not validate that
the server obeyed the requirement that a read call must not have
overlapping chunks and must not succeed without enough chunks to cover
the entire request.

The C<flags> parameter may be C<0> for no flags, or may contain
C<LIBNBD_CMD_FLAG_DF> meaning that the server should not reply with
more than one fragment (if that is supported - some servers cannot do
this, see L<nbd_can_df(3)>). Libnbd does not validate that the server
actually obeys the flag.

Issue the block status command to the NBD server.  If
supported by the server, this causes metadata context
information about blocks beginning from the specified
offset to be returned. The C<count> parameter is a hint: the
server may choose to return less status, or the final block
may extend beyond the requested range. If multiple contexts
are supported, the number of blocks and cumulative length
of those blocks need not be identical between contexts.

Depending on which metadata contexts were enabled before
connecting (see L<nbd_add_meta_context(3)>) and which are
supported by the server (see L<nbd_can_meta_context(3)>) this call
returns information about extents by calling back to the
C<extent> function.  The callback cannot call C<nbd_*> APIs on the
same handle since it holds the handle lock and will
cause a deadlock.  If the callback returns C<-1>, and no earlier
error has been detected, then the overall block status command
will fail with any non-zero value stored into the callback's
C<error> parameter (with a default of C<EPROTO>); but any further
contexts will still invoke the callback.

The C<extent> function is called once per type of metadata available,
with the C<user_data> passed to this function.  The C<metacontext>
parameter is a string such as C<\"base:allocation\">.  The C<entries>
array is an array of pairs of integers with the first entry in each
pair being the length (in bytes) of the block and the second entry
being a status/flags field which is specific to the metadata context.
(The number of pairs passed to the function is C<nr_entries/2>.)  The
NBD protocol document in the section about
C<NBD_REPLY_TYPE_BLOCK_STATUS> describes the meaning of this array;
for contexts known to libnbd, B<E<lt>libnbd.hE<gt>> contains constants
beginning with C<LIBNBD_STATE_> that may help decipher the values.
On entry to the callback, the C<error> parameter contains the errno
value of any previously detected error, but even if an earlier error
was detected, the current C<metacontext> and C<entries> are valid.

It is possible for the extent function to be called
more times than you expect (if the server is buggy),
so always check the C<metacontext> field to ensure you
are receiving the data you expect.  It is also possible
that the extent function is not called at all, even for
metadata contexts that you requested.  This indicates
either that the server doesn't support the context
or for some other reason cannot return the data.

The C<flags> parameter may be C<0> for no flags, or may contain
C<LIBNBD_CMD_FLAG_REQ_ONE> meaning that the server should
return only one extent per metadata context where that extent
does not exceed C<count> bytes; however, libnbd does not
validate that the server obeyed the flag."

clean shutdown.

=item 0

We are not expected to interact with the server file descriptor from
the current state. It is not worth attempting to use L<poll(2)>; if
the connection is not dead, then state machine progress must instead
come from some other means such as L<nbd_aio_connect(3)>.

=item C<LIBNBD_AIO_DIRECTION_READ> = 1

We are expected next to read from the server.  If using L<poll(2)>
you would set C<events = POLLIN>.  If C<revents> returns C<POLLIN>
or C<POLLHUP> you would then call L<nbd_aio_notify_read(3)>.

Note that once libnbd reaches L<nbd_aio_is_ready(3)>, this direction is
returned even when there are no commands in flight (see
L<nbd_aio_in_flight(3)>). In a single-threaded use of libnbd, it is not
worth polling until after issuing a command, as otherwise the server
will never wake up the poll. In a multi-threaded scenario, you can
have one thread begin a polling loop prior to any commands, but any
other thread that issues a command will need a way to kick the
polling thread out of poll in case issuing the command changes the
needed polling direction. Possible ways to do this include polling
for activity on a pipe-to-self, or using L<pthread_kill(3)> to send
a signal that is masked except during L<ppoll(2)>.

=item C<LIBNBD_AIO_DIRECTION_WRITE> = 2

We are expected next to write to the server.  If using L<poll(2)>
you would set C<events = POLLOUT>.  If C<revents> returns C<POLLOUT>
you would then call L<nbd_aio_notify_write(3)>.

=item C<LIBNBD_AIO_DIRECTION_BOTH> = 3

We are expected next to either read or write to the server.  If using
L<poll(2)> you would set C<events = POLLIN|POLLOUT>.  If only one of
C<POLLIN> or C<POLLOUT> is returned, then see above.  However, if both
are returned, it is better to call only L<nbd_aio_notify_read(3)>, as
processing the server's reply may change the state of the connection
and invalidate the need to write more commands.
